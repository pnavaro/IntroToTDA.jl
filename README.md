This is the notebook written from [Melinda Kleczynski video](https://youtu.be/ZWEtomyEzts).

It uses the Julia package [Eirene.jl](https://github.com/Eetion/Eirene.jl) and dataset comes from
[phillytreemap](https://www.opentreemap.org/phillytreemap/map/?z=16/39.9521/-75.1478&q=%7B%22mapFeature.geom%22%3A%7B%22IN_BOUNDARY%22%3A%2231358%22%7D%7D)

This tutorial was contributed as part of [the WinCompTop+AATRN Tutorial-a-thon in Spring 2021](https://sites.google.com/view/aatrn-tutorial-a-thon).

I use the same example to try another package [Ripserer.jl](https://github.com/mtsch/Ripserer.jl). It is a little bit harder to use but seems more updated and more powerful.
